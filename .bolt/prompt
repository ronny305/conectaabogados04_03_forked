ConectaAbogados Project — Global Build Constraints

This project is a Spanish-language directory for law firms. The platform is called ConectaAbogados and will be developed slowly and intentionally in roadmap-based phases.

You are currently in **Roadmap Phase 1**.

Phase 1 includes only:
- A homepage (`/`) with law firm cards
- A dynamic profile page at `/bufete/[slug]`
- Profiles will be generated using structured JSON files

Do not generate anything beyond what’s described above.
- Do not implement layouts, filters, navigation, or design systems
- Do not install icon libraries, UI kits, or extra styling packages
- Do not assume data structures or create mock content

Data is sourced from JSON law firm profiles provided via webhook or local file.

All development must follow roadmap phases and will be guided by explicit prompts. Build only what is asked, nothing more.
